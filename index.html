          <br />
          <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li>
              <b>Phonograph:</b> Edison began his career as an inventor in
              Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other
              improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained
              him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment
              was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost
              magical. Edison became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New
              Jersey.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Carbon telephone transmitter:</b> In 1876, Edison began work to
              improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a
              "transmitter") by developing a carbon microphone, which consists
              of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would
              change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady
              direct current is passed between the plates through the granules
              and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current,
              creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying
              pressure of the sound wave.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Electric light:</b> In 1878, Edison began working on a system
              of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with
              gas and oil-based lighting.<br />In 1878, Edison formed the Edison
              Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers,
              including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask,[53] and the members of the
              Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of
              his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park.
              It was during this time that he said: "We will make electricity so
              cheap that only the rich will burn candles."
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Electric power distribution:</b> -After devising a commercially
              viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed
              an electric "utility" to compete with the existing gas light
              utilities. On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison
              Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system
              for electricity distribution. The company established the first
              investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station,
              New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl
              Street generating station's electrical power distribution system,
              which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in
              lower Manhattan.

              Some other inventions and projects:
            </h4>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Fluoroscopy:</b> Edison is credited with designing and
              producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine
              that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that
              calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images
              than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm
              RÃ¶ntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint
              images.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Tasimeter:</b> Edison invented a highly sensitive device, that
              he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation. His
              impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from
              the solar corona during the total Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Telegraph improvements:</b> The key to Edison's fortunes was
              telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a
              telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This
              allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the
              first electricity-based broadcast system. On August 9, 1892,
              Edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <b>Motion pictures:</b> Edison was granted a patent for the motion
              picture camera or "Kinetograph". He did the electromechanical
              design while his employee William Kennedy Dickson, a photographer,
              worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the
              credit for the invention belongs to Dickson. In 1891, Thomas
              Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was
              installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple
              films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly
              exhibited May 20, 1891.
